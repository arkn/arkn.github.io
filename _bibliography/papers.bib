  abstract = {The supernumerary robotic limb system expands the motor function of human users by adding extra artificially designed limbs. It is important for us to embody the system as if it is a part of one's own body and to maintain cognitive transparency in which the cognitive load is suppressed. Embodiment studies have been conducted with an expansion of bodily functions through a ``substitution'' and ``extension''. However, there have been few studies on the ``addition'' of supernumerary body parts. In this study, we developed a supernumerary robotic limb system that operates in a virtual environment, and then evaluated whether the extra limb can be regarded as a part of one's own body using a questionnaire and whether the perception of peripersonal space changes with a visuotactile crossmodal congruency task. We found that the participants can embody the extra-limbs after using the supernumerary robotic limb system. We also found a positive correlation between the perceptual change in the crossmodal congruency task and the subjective feeling that the number of one's arms had increased (supernumerary limb sensation). These results suggest that the addition of an extra body part may cause the participants to feel that they had acquired a new body part that differs from their original body part through a functional expansion.},

  abstract = {Manipulating a non-humanoid body using a mapping approach that translates human body activity into different structural movements enables users to perform tasks that are difficult with their innate bodies. However, a key challenge is how to design an effective mapping to control non-analogous body parts with the human body. To address this challenge, we designed an articulated virtual arm and investigated the effect of mapping methods on a user's manipulation experience. Specifically, we developed an unbranched 12-joint virtual arm with an octopus-like appearance. Using this arm, we conducted a user study to compare the effects of several mapping methods with different arrangements on task performance and subjective evaluations of embodiment and user preference. As a result, we identified three important factors in mapping: ``Visual and Configurational Similarity'', ``Kinematics Suitability for the User'', and ``Correspondence with Everyday Actions.'' Based on these findings, we discuss a mapping design for non-humanoid body manipulation.},

However, there are few previous studies on those transformations associated with the wearing of avatars with non-innate physical characteristics such as animal avatars, leaving many unexplored areas. In this study, we focused on the octopus as an example of an animal with non-native physical characteristics such as softness and structural consistency from arm to fingertip. Therefore, we developed an avatar that externally mimics the arm of an octopus, a box-shaped avatar, and a human arm-shaped avatar, and measured the movement of the right upper limb during manipulation and the sensory and cognitive changes after manipulation. The results showed that subjects felt their bodies became softer and their body image changed after manipulating the avatar that imitated an octopus arm. The possibility of behavioral change was also confirmed with the octopus avater.},

Typically, one assumes that the causal relationships can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and makes additional assumptions to ensure that the DAG can be recovered from the observed data. In this study, we propose the quantum Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for nonlinear causal discovery based on quantum kernel methods. The qPC algorithm takes advantage of the quantum kernel-based conditional independent test. Through the synthetic data experiment, we show that the qPC algorithm outperforms the classical method in the regime of a small number of samples. This suggests that the kernel-based causal discovery can significantly improve performance under such conditions. Our experiments highlight that the proposed algorithm can accurately support classical algorithms in causal discovery, paving the way for future advances with the utilization of quantum computation.},

MRE is often described as image-based palpation that can be used to characterize disease because the mechanical properties of tissues are often dramatically affected by the presence of disease processes. MRE pulse sequences obtain shear wave images by synchronizing motion sensitized gradients (MSG) with an external vibrator. A quantitative shear modulus map is calculated from the shear wave images. However, the magnitude property of the external vibrator and nonlinearity of the imaged object often induce unwanted higher harmonics that distort the shear wave images and impair the estimation of the elastic modulus.

In this study, we apply the MSGs to gradient moment nulling (GMN) technique for reducing bulk motion effect and optimize them to minimize the contribution of higher harmonics to the shear wave images and therefore improve the accuracy of shear modulus estimation. Phantom and in-vivo study was performed to confirm the performance of the proposed MRE pulse sequence. The results show that the optimized MSG is able to acquire single frequency shear wave images even when large amplitude harmonic waves are present in the imaged object. Additionally, the proposed MRE pulse sequence reduced cardiac motion artifact. These results suggest that the proposed pulse sequence might be useful for in-vivo MRE studies.},

  abstract = {The discovery of causal relationships from observed data has attracted significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, epidemiology, and biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying systems is often unavailable, and real data are often associated with nonlinear causal structures, which make the direct use of most conventional causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not assume any underlying model structures. Based on the independence conditional tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed qPC algorithm can explore causal relationships from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graph parts of causal structures, demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits a significantly better performance, particularly with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for robust and accurate inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical algorithms typically fail. Additionally, the effectiveness of this method was validated using the Boston Housing dataset as a real-world application. These findings demonstrate the new potential of quantum circuit-based causal discovery methods in addressing practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios where traditional approaches have shown limitations.},
